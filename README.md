The main goal of this project is for us to grasp and utilize PySpark to analyze the huge Spotify dataset and get important insights into worldwide music trends, user behavior, and market performance. These insights will be useful for people and companies looking to increase platform visibility and make educated investment decisions. The dataset includes information on daily streams, artist popularity levels, localities, and more.

To get a full insight into the music streaming industry, we undertook a detailed study of the Spotify dataset, covering artists, regions, genres, streams, and songs, among other characteristics. Following that, we performed clustering analysis on the top songs to identify similarities in their features, which indicate new industry trends.

Furthermore, to have a better knowledge of the music streaming industry, we go on to compare Spotify to its competitors, including Apple Music. We have made relevant conclusions based on our findings regarding why the sector, and specifically Spotify, offers a good investment opportunity.
